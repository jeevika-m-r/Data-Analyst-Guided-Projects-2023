# **Jeevika M R – Data Analyst Portfolio**

**About**

Hi! I'm Jeevika, I have an analytical background in Biotechnology. My journey began in the meticulous world of biotechnology, where I honed my analytical skills dissecting complex biological systems. Now, I leverage that expertise to transmute raw data into actionable insights across diverse industries.

My biotech background grants me a unique perspective, enabling me to bridge the gap between scientific rigor and data-driven solutions. Whether it's optimizing production processes, predicting market trends, or uncovering hidden patterns, I unleash the power of data to drive informed decision-making.

**Projects**

I will summarise the data analytical projects by brief description of the technology stack used to solve cases within this section.

**Covid Data Exploration**

Code: [Covid data exploration](https://github.com/jeevika-m-r/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid_sql_data_exploration.sql)

Description: The dataset contains data in respect of the number of Covid19 cases, deaths and vaccination records per country between 2020 and 2021. The steps involved in this project are loading, cleaning, pre-processing of the data and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

Skills: Converting into Data types, Aggregate functions, Windows functions, Joins, Creating Views, Temp Table, CTEs

Technology: SQL Server

**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning**

Code: [Nashville housing data cleaning](https://github.com/jeevika-m-r/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NashvilleHousing_SQL_DataCleaning.sql)

Description: Data set shows a list of homes sold in Nashville from 2013 to 2019. The following steps are included in this project: data loading, data cleansing and pre-processing.

Skills: DML (Data Manipulation Language), DDL (Data Definition Language), DQL (Data Query Language)

Technology: SQL Server

**Analysing Classic model cars and other vehicles**

Code: [analysing classic cars and other vehicles](https://github.com/jeevika-m-r/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/mint_classics_SQL_DataExtraction.sql)

Description: The dataset contains data about classic cars and other vehicles stored in a respective warehouse. The purpose of this study is to assist in reducing the number of warehouses through data analysis. The steps involved in this project are loading, cleaning, pre-processing of the data and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

Skills: DML (Data Manipulation Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Technology: MySQL

**Movie Correlation Analysis**

Code: [movie correlation analysis using python](https://github.com/jeevika-m-r/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Movie%20Correlation.ipynb)

Goal: To determine the correlation between the given dataset.

Description: Explore the movie industry's evolution with a dataset spanning 1986-2020, featuring 7668 films. This project involves loading, cleaning, and EDA, scrutinizing correlations like budget vs. gross earnings through Pearson's analysis, offering insights into cinematic trends and industry dynamics.

Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Correlation matrices

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Results: The analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation to the gross earnings while the company has no significant correlation.

**Hotel Booking Analysis:**

Code: [hotel booking analysis using python](https://github.com/jeevika-m-r/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Hotel%20Booking.pdf)

Goal: To reduce number of cancellation in city and resort hotels

Description: City and resort hotels face revenue challenges due to high cancellation rates, leading to suboptimal room use. The primary goal is to reduce cancellations for improved revenue efficiency, guiding our comprehensive business advice. The report delves into hotel booking cancellations and unrelated factors, providing insights for enhanced yearly revenue strategies

Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Data Analysis

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Results: The report reveals a concerning trend of high cancellation rates in city hotel, impacting revenue and room utilization. Lowering cancellation rates emerges as the primary goal for both hotels, aiming to enhance efficiency and revenue generation.

**Hospitality Domain Analysis:**

Code: [hospitality domain analysis](https://github.com/jeevika-m-r/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Hospitality%20Domain%20Analysis.pbix)

Goal: To leverage "Business and Data Intelligence" to formulate actionable insights that assist the company in regaining market share and optimizing revenue strategies in the luxury/business hotels category.

Description:AtliQ Grands, a leader in Indian hospitality for 20 years, is losing market share in luxury/business hotels. To regain ground, they seek a third-party data analyst to create metrics, develop a dashboard, and extract insights from historical data for strategic decisions, as they lack an in-house analytics team.

Skills: DAX, Data Analysis, Data Visualization

Technology: Power BI
